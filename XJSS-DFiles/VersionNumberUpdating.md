#### SU - Software Update <br> GU - General Update <br> SUN - Software Update Number <br> ENOTSUN - Extra Number Other Than Software Update Number <br> Number Jumping - Increasing a number a set amount

### When Publishing To Github And Updating Version Number, "Number Jumping" (going up in number a set amount) differs from a software update and a general update.

## Software Update (SU)
### A SU is released everytime a code for the program has been changed. (No matter if code is removed or added)
### Jumps one digit

1.1.0 > (SU) 1.2.0

### And when there is a extra number after the software update number (SUN) jump like normal dropping the ENOTSUN to zero (Extra Number Other Than Software Update Number)

1.3.5 > (SU) > 1.4.0

<br>

## General Update (GU)
### A GU is when there is an addition or subtraction to anything other than the code itself (Example: Added Photos to GitHub or changing of the VNU.md file)
### Jumps one digit after the SUN

1.1.0 > (GU) > 1.1.1

<br>

## So with that being said

#### Version Number: 1.3.6
#### Number Meaning: ReleaseUpdateNumber.SoftwareUpdateNumber.SubGeneralUpdateNumber
#### So with that version v1.3.6 was in release one with a software version of three and a sub general update of six
#### NOTE: SUN only works in the format of X.X.X

## Footer Version Updating

#### Very simple, XX.XX.XX.XXXX (ex: 10.01.22.0002) MM.DD.YY.VERSIONNUMBER
